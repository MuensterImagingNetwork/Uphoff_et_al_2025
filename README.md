SVEP1 enables efficient binding of Angiopoietin2 to the TIE1 receptor, allowing receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling
Uphoff et al. 2025 eLife

The Pipeline was used to analyze the nuclear exclusion of FOXO1 in human lymphatic endothelial cells after SVEP1 and ANG2 stimulation (Figure 4).
The pipeline identify single cells stained with a junctional marker and calculates the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic expression of the protein of interest for each cell.
Raw images, were taken using ZEISS Elyra 7 superresolution microscope in Apotome mode with a 20x objective and processed with ZEN Microscopy Software (Zen blue 3.5 and Zen black).
